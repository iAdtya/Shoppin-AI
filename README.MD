## 1. Autoencoder-Based Approach

- Use an autoencoder to encode input images into a latent space (a compressed feature representation).
- During a query, compare the latent vector of the query image with those of stored images using metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.

### Advantages of Autoencoder-Based Approach

- Simple and unsupervised.
- Effective for dimensionality reduction.

### Applications of Autoencoder-Based Approach

- Useful for small-to-medium-scale datasets with diverse image content.

## 2. Vision Transformer (ViT)-Based Approach

- Use a Vision Transformer (ViT) to encode input images into sequence-based embeddings.
- Utilize self-attention mechanisms to capture global image relationships.
- Perform similarity comparisons using distance metrics or clustering techniques.

### Advantages of ViT-Based Approach

- Captures global context effectively.
- Scalable for large and diverse datasets.

### Applications of ViT-Based Approach

- Works well for highly complex or structured datasets.

## 3. KNN-Based Approach with ViT

- Use a Vision Transformer (ViT) to encode input images into embeddings.
- Build a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) index for the embeddings.
- Perform similarity search using KNN to find the closest embeddings.

### Advantages of KNN-Based Approach with ViT

- Efficient for large datasets with pre-built indices.
- Can handle dynamic updates to the dataset.

### Applications of KNN-Based Approach with ViT

- Suitable for real-time search applications.

## 4. Diffusion Model-Based Approach

- Use a diffusion model to extract features from images.
- Compare the features using cosine similarity to find similar images.

### Advantages of Diffusion Model-Based Approach

- High precision and recall.
- Effective for complex image representations.

### Applications of Diffusion Model-Based Approach

- Ideal for high-accuracy requirements in small datasets.
